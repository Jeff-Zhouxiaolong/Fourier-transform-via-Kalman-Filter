# Fourier-transform-via-Kalman-Filter
This is an attempt to perform data fusion in frequency domain using Kalman Filter.
Unfortunately, this has already been done in the literature. Mathematically, combining information from different number of frequency bins and time duration is not correct and hence this attempt has lost its purpose. However, this would serve has a reference if Compressed Filter has to a certain extent able to solve PDEs in the time domain and be able to be adapted to the frequency domain. Its purpose then is still vague (with thesis aim in mind) but not far fetched.
